Hi, I’m **Xin Luo (雒鑫)**—a Ph.D. student in Computer Technology at the
[University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
I am advised by [Prof. S. Kevin Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=8eNm2GMAAAAJ){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
My research focuses on **model compression, pruning, quantization, and inference acceleration**
for large-scale vision and language models.
I’m passionate about turning heavyweight networks into lean, deployment-ready systems without sacrificing performance.
If you share an interest in faster, more efficient AI, feel free to

Hi, I’m Xin Luo (雒鑫)—a Ph.D. student in Computer Technology at the University of Science and Technology of China. My research centers on model compression, pruning, quantization, and inference acceleration for large-scale vision and language models. I’m passionate about turning heavyweight networks into lean, deployment-ready systems without sacrificing performance. If you share an interest in faster, more efficient AI, let’s connect!
